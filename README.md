Dimchat (Server)
==============

Server application to host Dimchat clients. 

Dimchat-server is a small chat-server application for Dimchat-supporting clients.
Clients connect to the server and can chat with one another, or utilize an extenable array of commands.
Constantly being improved and tweaked.

What's the "dim" for?
Dim refers to a variety of meanings concerning this application. One, for instance, is that stand-alone chat applications are becoming less common due to them being implemented into more grand services or applications (such as chatting in video games). Here, dim would stand for the dim mood of a chat without boundaries. Talk about whatever you want, don't be constricted by lights that point you towards inside-the-box thinking. Just be able to converse naturally.
